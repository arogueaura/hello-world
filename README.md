# hello-world
~~An hour after installing Linux (setting up my 2nd system from deb to arch) and now I've been commanded by Git to say hello world!~~
I am an audio producer / video editior. I'm aspiring to work with VFX or 3D as well currently dabbling in that. I bricked my desktop after trying Linux via Ubuntu somehow. I've switched to Arch for my second attempt & and am learning basic code etc in my free time. 
**Amendment:**
Came back to this learning material and it's honestly so dense I've had to pause on the regular. Currently adding this additonal text to the readme.
To make sure there's no confusion to be had the intial info's been striken! Mostly per command of the learning material this incredible project has offically updated and is now the proud owner of a newly updated branch.
